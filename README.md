                                     OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Multimedia System (CSDLO5011) is a specialized Department Level Optional Course (DLOC) in the Third Year (Semester V) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. The course explores the integration of multiple media types—text, graphics, audio, video, and animation—into single applications, focusing on the underlying technologies, compression algorithms, and system architectures.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in Multimedia Systems:

- **Multimedia Fundamentals**: Introduction to hardware/software, system architecture, and applications.
- **Text & Digital Image**: Formatting, encoding, and image processing fundamentals.
- **Digital Audio & Video**: Digitization process, PCM, sampling, and video streaming techniques.
- **Compression Algorithms**: Lossless and lossy compression (Huffman, LZW, JPEG, MPEG).
- **Animation & Virtual Reality**: Principles of animation, VR architectures, and modeling.
- **Multimedia Networking**: QoS requirements, protocols, and real-time streaming issues.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As a computer engineer, understanding multimedia processing is essential for developing media-rich web applications, streaming services, and interactive systems. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental multimedia concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through MS.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.
